<p>New Directions in the Study of the Mind was a research project based in the <a href="http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Faculty of Philosophy in Cambridge</a>, supported by the <a href="http://www.templeton.org/" target="_blank">John Templeton Foundation</a>. The aim of the project was to investigate questions about intentionality and consciousness from a non-physicalist, non-reductive perspective. More details about the intellectual and historical background, as well as the research questions of the project, may be found <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The project lasted for two years, from July 2015 to July 2017. During this time, we ran seminars, workshops, and a major conference. For more more details, including recordings of these events, go <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/events/">here</a>. You can also find links to research by the project's members <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/output/">here</a>.

<p>In addition, we funded a number of research projects, carried out by both philosophers and scientists, that take non-physicalist and non-reductionist approaches to the study of the mind. You can find details of our funded projects <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/initiatives/">here</a>. </p>
