Consciousness has been one of the stumbling blocks for physicalist theories of the mind. Much effort has been dedicated to finding the physical basis of consciousness. But how does our knowledge of the mind connect with our knowledge of the brain? Physicalist theories have struggled to give satisfactory answers to this question. In this conference we will take a different turn, by investigating non-physicalist approaches to the mind. We will address questions such as: What ontological categories do conscious phenomena belong to? Does the consciousness of sensory experience differ from that involved in thought? How is it possible to investigate consciousness without assuming physicalism? We aim to open up the discussion by exploring alternatives to physicalism in the philosophical and scientific study of consciousness.

# Access

Trinity Hall provides access information <a href="http://www.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/prospective-students/life/support/detail.asp?ItemID=1668" target="_blank">here</a>. Some core points:

- Parking on Central Site is extremely difficult, especially due to bollard restrictions in town centre. Several disabled parking bays on King's Parade.
- Graham Storey Room (where the conference will be held): Ground floor and accessible.
- College grounds and buildings: Level access to main entrance, with bell at gate. Level throughout. Front court has fairly even slabbed paving, and cobbles can be avoided. Surfaces further inside are concrete, paved or gravel. Almost all public areas accessible to wheelchair users. Small gardens on site. Gravel paths and level lawn. Two benches overlooking river.
- Accessible toilets located on ground floor of staircase close to porters' lodge.
- Assistance dogs welcome.
- Large print information on request.
- Lights around college grounds turn on automatically at dusk. Public areas generally well lit.
- Induction loop installed in porters' lodge. Loops can be acquired if needed. Little traffic noise, as the college is off the main street. Generally quiet around college.
